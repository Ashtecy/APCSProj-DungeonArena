Change Log

May 23,2015 Basic Dungeon Generation: Basic 20 by 25 tile dungeon in which approximately one third of the tiles are walls. Played around with branching. Started work on the menu screen with a play button and implemented a loading screen.

May 24,2015 "Backspace" will return the user from the game screen to the menu screen. Clicking play once again after exiting to the menu screen will generate a new dungeon. Began testing random item spawning.

May 27,2015 Added features for equiptment, items, inventory, stats interactions between each other.

May 28, 2015 Working on Adventurer movement.

May 29, 2015 Adventuerer can now move using the numpad, allowing diagonal movement. Working on camera to center on the adventuerer and avoid loading the entire map. Equiptments affect the Adventurer stats. Equipting weapons seems to work properly, but have not tested it visually with the dungeon (i.e. picking weapons off the floor).

May 31, 2015 Working on interaction between items, beings, and tiles of the dungeon.

June 2, 2015 Broke movement and camera

June 4, 2015 Fixed movement and camera. player still walks through walls but that will be resolved shortly.

June 4, 2015 Better movement. Added a score screen as well, but it doesn't hold much information.

June 6, 2015 Player can pick up drops.

June 7, 2015 The player can attack and dead beings will drop items. Ending screen added.

June 8, 2015 Finished adding the abilities.

June 12, 2015 Improved loading speed.

June 13, 2015 Finished crappy animation and player log.
